    "# Tutorial #2 - Explore and Visualize\n",
    "Welcome to Cognitive Class Labs.  This notebook is the **second** in a series of \"getting started\" tutorials that is designed to introduce some basic concepts and help get you familiar with using the workbench.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore and visualize the olympic medals data that you added to your workbench in **Tutorial #1 - Get Data**. Specifically, this tutorial covers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load data in memory using a `pandas` DataFrame\n",
    "1. Explore and manipulate data using DataFrame functions\n",
    "1. Group data by columns \n",
    "1. Calculate statistics over grouped data\n",
    "1. Plot data using the pre-installed `matplotlib` package\n",
    "1. Plot data using a third-party library\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do this in the context of answering the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which discipline and event has awarded the most gold medals?\n",
    "1. Which country has won the most gold, silver, and bronze medals?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "* A basic familiarity with the [Python Programming Language](https://docs.python.org/3/) and the [IPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/2.x/examples/Notebook/Index.ipynb).\n",
    "* A basic understanding of [common graphical techniques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis#Techniques) used for exploratory data analysis. \n",
    "* A basic understanding of [`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load Data\n",
    "Our first step is to load the olympic medal data into a pandas [DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/dsintro.html#dataframe) in memory.  As demonstrated in **Tutorial #1 - Get Data**, we can do this by \n",
    "following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the olympic medal data in CSV format.  Click this [Box link](https://ibm.box.com/s/8u9yc1hj7ddvptablj312asm6sfgn5gw) to open the document in a new browser window. \n",
    "1. Save the CSV file to your computer by clicking on the Download button.\n",
    "1. Drag the CSV file from your desktop onto the workbench (Note that the CSV file appears under your **Recent Data** panel in the sidebar.)\n",
    "1. Click the arrow button (**>**) next to the CSV file you just uploaded.\n",
    "1. In the section that appears below the item, click \"Rename\"\n",
    "1. Change the name of the file to \"medals.csv\" and press Enter or click outside the name.\n",
    "1. Execute the code cell by clicking the (**&#9658;**) play button on the notebook toolbar, or by pressing Ctrl-Enter."
